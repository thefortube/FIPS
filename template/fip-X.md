## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the FIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the FIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the FIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the FIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the FIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the FIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the FIP will address the issue!-->

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the FIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This is a high level overview of *how* the FIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces ForTube Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

这是新FIP的推荐模板。请注意，FIP编号将由编辑指定。当打开pull request以提交您的FIP时，请在文件名中使用缩写标题`fip-draft_title_abbrev.md`。标题不超过44个字符。

## 总结
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
"如果你不能简单地解释它，你就不能很好地理解它。”
简单描述该提案想要实现的结果。这个描述应该是非技术性的，对于普通社区成员来说相对友好。

## 摘要
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the FIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the FIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

对于想要达到的变更做出简短描述（约200字），摘要应清楚地描述提案的变更。这是FIP实施后“将要”完成的事情，而不是“为什么”要做或“如何”做。如果FIP建议部署一个新合约，写下“我们提议部署一个将执行XX的新合约”。



## 动机
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the FIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the FIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the FIP will address the issue!-->

这是关于为什么要提出FIP的问题陈述。它应该清楚地解释“为什么”当前协议并不完善。解释“为什么”需要进行改进，是非常重要的。如果FIP建议改进某些计算方式，则必须说明当前计算“为什么”不准确或错误的原因。这里不要描述FIP将如何解决问题。



## 规范
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->



### 概述
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the FIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

这是关于FIP将“如何”解决问题的更高层次的概述。概述应该清楚地描述将如何实现新的功能。


### 理论基础
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

解释你提出解决问题的理由。你为什么要用这种方式实施变革，有什么考虑和权衡。理论基础充实了设计的动机，以及为什么要做出特定的设计决策。它应该描述曾经考虑过的替代设计和相关工作。理论基础也可以提供社区达成共识的证据，并针对讨论过程中提出的重要异议或关注点进行讨论。



### 技术规范

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces ForTube Finance currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

技术规范需要概述提案变更的公共API。也就是说，对ForTube目前公开的任何接口的更改，或者新接口的创建。


### 测试用例
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for FIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

对于FIP来说，实施的测试用例是必需的，但可以包含在实施的过程中。
